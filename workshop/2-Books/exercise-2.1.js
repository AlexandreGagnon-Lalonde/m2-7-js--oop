// Create a Book class and then intantiate it 5 times with various books
// include the following properties in the constructor
//      - title, genre, author, read, startReadDate, endReadDate
// Declare the books as book1, book2, book3, book4, book5
//
// Remember that it isn't necessary to pass arguments for all of the parameters.
// if you haven't read the book, there should not be a startReadDate or endReadDate
//
// Console.log them to verify that all is working.

class Book {
    
}

console.log(book1, book2, book3, book4, book5);
